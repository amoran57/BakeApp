Cook the crumpets for a total of about 10 minutes on the first side, until their tops are riddled with small bubbles/holes. They should be starting to look a bit dry around the edges. Their bottoms will be a mottled, light-golden brown. Note: They probably won't be as full of holes as store-bought crumpets; that's OK.",
            
            "Turn the crumpets over, and cook for an additional 5 minutes, to finish cooking the insides and to brown the tops gently. This isn't traditional; real crumpets are white on top, but the crumpet police won't chastise you for adding a little color to the tops.",
            
            "Remove the crumpets from the pan, and repeat with the remaining batter, until all the crumpets are cooked. Serve warm. Or cool completely, wrap in plastic, and store at room temperature. To enjoy, warm in the toaster. Serve with butter, or butter and jam."

              "Preheat the oven to 350°F. Set 1 cup of butter out to soften. Take six bags of Earl Grey tea and cut them open; measure out 2 tablespoons. If you have loose leaf tea rather than bags, you may want to grind the leaves to a finer consistency.",
    "In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, tea, baking powder, salt, and black pepper. Set aside.",
    "In a mixer, whip the butter at high speed until battered, then add the sugar. Beat on high for about 2 minutes. The mixture should be light and nigh fluffy.",
    "Add the egg and the vanilla, beating until just combined.",
    "Slowly add the dry mixture, beating until just combined.",
    "Scoop out tablespoon-sized balls of dough, and flatten them gently between your hands. Set them about 3 inches apart on a baking sheet.",
    "Bake at 350°F for 13-17 minutes, depending whether you like your cookies soft and a bit doughy or firm and a bit crunchy. Either way, bake at least until set in the center. Remove the cookies from the sheet as soon as they are cool enough to do so, and put them in the fridge to cool. Cookies are best served chilled."
