# BakeApp

BakeApp is a SwiftUI app that allows the user to view a random recipe from a file of (currently 15 or 16
but eventually about) 30 recipes. The core idea and functionality is to view a random recipe; however,
users can indicate whether they are short on time or are missing ingredients, and the app will generate a 
recipe which meets the user's indicated restrictions, as best as possible. Also, the user does have an 
option to browse all the recipes in the system and view recipes manually. Furthermore, the user can indicate recipes which he would rather not see in the future, and those recipes will be removed from the system (though they can be brought back).

Newly added is an option to submit the user's own recipes, either through text or image submission. Also new is the ability for the app to read additional recipes from the associated Firebase server.
