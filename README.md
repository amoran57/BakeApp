# BakeApp

BakeApp is a SwiftUI app that allows the user to view a random recipe from a file of (currently 5 or 6
but eventually about) 30 recipes. The core idea and functionality is to view a random recipe; however,
users can indicate whether they are short on time or are missing ingredients, and the app will generate a 
recipe which meets the user's indicated restrictions, as best as possible. Also, the user does have an 
option to browse all the recipes in the system and view recipes manually.
